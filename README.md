# www-skeleton
A skeleton for making a project page for the group website

* Fork the main repository to have your own GitHub copy, to which you'll then be allowed to push changes for your own project.
* Clone your GitHub repository onto your local machine
* Add the original repository as an additional remote repository on your local repository. You'll then be able to fetch changes published in that repository directly, in case changes are made (e.g., update to bootstrap version, etc.).
* Make your modifications and your own commits locally.
* Push your changes to your GitHub repository (as you generally won't have the write permissions on the project's repository directly).
* You, I, (or someone) can git pull your repository contents into the webspace.
